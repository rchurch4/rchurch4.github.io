During and after the completion of my Ph.D., I have held a number of positions outside of the realm of research.  I am currently the Head of Data Science at [5-Out](https://www.5out.io/), a predictive analytics startup focused on providing restaurants with accurate and insightful forecasts for things like revenue, staffing requirements, inventory management, and food prep.

Prior to that, I was a data science and machine learning consultant at 5-Out (January 2022-July 2022).
In 2020 and early 2021, I was a consultant to a group of investors, conducting due diligence on a prospective investment in a cryptocurrency startup and a sports gambling startup.

Between 2015 and 2021, I was a software engineering and data science consultant for Churchill Engineers in New Jersey, where I performed various services to improve the productivity of the accounting department and project managers.  I reverse-engineered obfuscated database schemas and wrote a number of SQL reports to streamline the workflow of accountants.  I also designed and built a web application using the python Django web framework that enables project managers to easily and efficiently track the progress of employees in the field.  The application, called Inspector DataBase [(IDB)](churchillidb.com), allows managers to quickly visualize employees whose jobs are almost over, who are due for raises, who need to renew certifications, and a plethora of other information.  It saves them hours of work every time a new job proposal is written, and helps employees get matched to projects so that as few people are idle as possible.

In summer 2016, I worked as a software engineering intern at a startup called [Spotfund](https://www.spotfund.com/).  At Spotfund, I designed and implemented a recommendation system for categorizing charities based on their official descriptions, names, and related charities.  I also designed and implented an analytics and accounting reconciliation platform.  Outside of the data science realm, I implemented backend features for the Spotfund platform using the Django web framework, and customized a URL shortener to incorporate deeplinks in order to track marketing efforts.
