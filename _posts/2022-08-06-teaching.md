In the Spring term of 2023, I am teaching Programming Language Fundamentals (CS381) at Oregon State University Cascades.  If you are a student, you can find everything you need on Canvas.

Throughout my time as a graduate student, I was a teaching assistant many times.  Between 2016 and 2021, I was a TA for Data Science (Fall 2016, Fall 2019, Fall 2021), and Databases (Spring 2016, Spring 2018).
I also helped teach at [Georgetown University Women Coders](https://guwecode.georgetown.domains/) events from 2016 to 2021.

I love teaching and am happy to continue teaching alongside my other jobs.
