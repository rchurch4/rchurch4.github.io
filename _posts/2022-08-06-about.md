I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgetown University in May 2022, after defending my dissertation in December 2021.  Prior to that, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at Georgetown in 2017, and my Bachelor's degree at Boston University in 2015.

During my Master's and Ph.D. I was advised by Lisa Singh and worked in her research group, the Georgetown DataLab, and in conjunction with the Massive Data Institute (MDI) at the McCourt School of Public Policy.

When I'm not working, you can find me surfing, skiing, kitesurfing or playing ice hockey.  I was a captain of the Georgetown Club Ice Hockey team as a grad student. 

All of the pictures on this website were taken of or by me while traveling.  I have been all over, but there's still much more to explore!
